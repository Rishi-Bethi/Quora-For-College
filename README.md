# Quora-For-College

    The application is still in early stages, it can be customized according to usage. We plan on hosting 
    it, it is a platform for college students like us to post queries and answer and help out our 
    peers efficiently. It can be hosted after adding further features like filtering questions by favorite 
    categories, not allowing a repeated question, tagging an answer, enhancing the profile page like 
    visiting another user, following them etc, allowing image addition in answers as well. We can also 
    add posts which will be different from question in respect that they are providing information 
    instead of asking them. We can also add the option of like and comment in questions and post and 
    implement machine learning algorithms for better results and searches. After hosting it can be used 
    for daily purposes to interact with our seniors or alumni or simply help out our classmates and 
    juniors. This can also be used as a place for collaboration of like-minded people to meet and build 
    projects and indulge into research with each other.
